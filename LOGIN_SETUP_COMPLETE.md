### 5. **Authentication Flow**

## 📁 File Structure Created
```
src/app/
├── (auth)/

└── account/
    └── orders/
        └── page.jsx          # Redirect destination page
```

## 🔧 Dependencies Added
- `axios`: ^1.10.0 (for HTTP requests)

## 🎨 UI Design
- Matches your existing Aniga's Attire branding
- Uses the same logo and color scheme (orange #f54a00)
- Green gradient background consistent with your Hero component
- Modern card-based layout with shadows
- Fully responsive design

## 🚀 How to Test
1. Start your Django backend server on `http://localhost:8000`
2. Run your Next.js dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/login`
4. Test with valid/invalid credentials

The login page is now ready for production use! It includes all the requirements you specified and follows modern React/Next.js best practices.
